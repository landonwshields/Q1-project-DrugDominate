    <p id="aboutInfo"> Coming from the healthcare industry, specifically working in pharmacies, I noticed how frequently people would forget to take their medications. Many people would not think about how multiple drugs would interact with each other. Now, DrugDominate is here to help you dominate your medications! On the main page you can input two medications and see if they have any undesired interactions, as well as the severity of the interaction.  The reminders page can help you set reminders to take your medications.</p>
